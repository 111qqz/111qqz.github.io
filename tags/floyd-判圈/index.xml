      <description>Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one. Note: 1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only). 2. You must use only constant, _O_(1) extra space. 3. Your runtime complexity should be less than</description>

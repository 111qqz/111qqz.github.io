      <description>Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, &amp;hellip;, an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2. 题意</description>

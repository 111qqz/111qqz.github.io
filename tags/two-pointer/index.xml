      <description>Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue. Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively. 题意：一个数组，由0,1,2组成，现在</description>

      <description>Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, &amp;hellip;, an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2. 题意</description>

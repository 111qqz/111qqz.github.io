&lt;h2 id="description"&gt;Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pasture contains a small, contiguous grove of trees that has no 'holes' in the middle of the it. Bessie wonders: how far is it to walk around that grove and get back to my starting position? She's just sure there is a way to do it by going from her start location to successive locations by walking horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and counting each move as a single step. Just looking at it, she doesn't think you could pass 'through' the grove on a tricky diagonal. Your job is to calculate the minimum number of steps she must take. Happily, Bessie lives on a simple world where the pasture is represented by a grid with R rows and C columns (1 &amp;lt;= R &amp;lt;= 50, 1 &amp;lt;= C &amp;lt;= 50). Here's a typical example where '.' is pasture (which Bessie may traverse), 'X' is the grove of trees, '&lt;em&gt;' represents Bessie's start and end position, and '+' marks one shortest path she can walk to circumnavigate the grove (i.e., the answer): ...+... ..+X+.. .+XXX+. ..+XXX+ ..+X..+ ...+++&lt;/em&gt; The path shown is not the only possible shortest path; Bessie might have taken a diagonal step from her start position and achieved a similar length solution. Bessie is happy that she's starting 'outside' the grove instead of in a sort of 'harbor' that could complicate finding the best path.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

Key:

(1). Pose-driven, body part alignment, combine whole feature and body part feature, focus on alignment of part model, 

(2). Combine image label and human attributes classes, do classification with attributes and identity learning 

(3). Based on triplet loss, improve metric learning for an end to end learning

(4). Post-process, re-ranking
